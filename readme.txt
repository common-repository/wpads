WPAds is a simple and light weight ad manager for WordPress.

== Description ==

WPAds is a free plugin for showing and managing ads on your WordPress site. It works very similarly to other ad servers, but because of its limited functionality, it is much easier to use. 

> <strong>Please read before updating</strong>
>
> This is a fixed version of WPAds which was not hosted on wordpress.org before.
> I updated this plugin to work for existing users with a newer version of WordPress, but would suggest new users to use [a better ad management plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/).
> Please, don’t update if you don’t use at least WordPress 4.7.

The main concepts of WPAds are zones and banners. After creating zones you can insert these ad positions in your template or in your posts, e.g. as positions for ads in header, sidebar or content. Than create some banners, paste the ad code you want to display and assign them to your ad zones. WPAds will serve your ads randomly to those positions. The rotation is based on a variable weight of your ads.

WPAds can show different ad formats (HTML, JS; PHP, Image ads) and support ad networks like Google AdSense, Yahoo Publishers Network, Amazon or Chikita.

Features:

* shortcodes for injection into posts and templates
* unlimited ads
